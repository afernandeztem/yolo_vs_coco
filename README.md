# YOLO vs COCO

In this github, I will show a small comparison between YOLO and COCO both dedicated to the detection of objects and thus explain above what each of them consists. In here, you can locate 2 ipynb and a presentation, where you can find the direct links to my google colab. The explanation of YOLO is much more extended in the ipynb file. I attached a couple of examples of these predictions.
